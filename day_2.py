"""

# Variables

"""
a variable is used to store data to an object / property.

name = "James"
age = 28
"""

# Type Conversion

"""
Type conversion can be used to format stored data from one type to another.

dollars = int(20)
price = float(11.50)
change = dollars - price
print(change)

Declaring the type while creating the variable is a good way to handle type conversion and can help with readibility.
"""

# Round Function

"""
The round function is used to round of float data to a certain decimal point.

savings = 2316.35

You could round while creating the variable like this:

savings = round(2316.35, 1)

Which would give us the float number rounded to '1' decimal place or you could do it this way:

print(round(savings, 1))

Converting the output in the print statment which should give the same output.
