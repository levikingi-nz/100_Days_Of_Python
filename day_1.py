# Input Function

"""
The input() function is used to generate user input, it then stores that data awaiting for assignment to a object, container or variable.

You can start by asking for the users age:

"""

# Len Function

"""
The len() function is used to calculate the length of characters stored in data. It can be used to help with character limitation and index scoping.

print(len(str(name)))

The code above should ask for the users input (name), then converts the data inputted in input() to str() format. Giving the number of letters in your name.
