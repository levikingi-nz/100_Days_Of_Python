# If/Else Conditionals

"""
If, Else and ElIf conditional statments used to insure that certain conditions are true in order to do a specific set of actions.

age = input("What is you age? ")

if age > 18:
In this example above we are using the if statement to determine the conditions needed to run the code indented on the next line.
  print("You can enter the store")
elif:
  print("Sorry, we didnt understand that. Try again later!)
else:
If the conditions are not true, then it will always default to the next line of code that is not in the same indented block.
  print("Sorry, come back when your older!)

  
Indetation is a big key to the structure of your code, its defines the start and end of actions set in the indented block of code from top to bottom.
